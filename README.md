# WIP - Satoshi's Garden

## A Lightning Network Visualizer and Explorer

Many tools for visualizing the Lightning Network lack interactivity and tools for viewing the state of the network, as well as one's own node within the context of a neighborhood or larger community.

`Satoshi's Garden` offers a web-based service and api for viewing and exploring the network, allowing users to filter by metrics like node conentivity and channel size.
